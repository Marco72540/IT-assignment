		<p> The basic idea of cloud gaming is like the other streaming platforms, such as "Netflix", "YouTube".
		    You will play your games on the server which owned by the companies that provide services.
		    Once you choose a game to play, the game will run in the server.
		    Then, every actions you made will become a command and send it to the server.
		    The server will execute the commands and streamed back to you with a small latency.
