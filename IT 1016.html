		<H2>Background information</H2>
		<p>Nowadays, the demands of gaming quality is being higher and higher.
   		   Many gamers are not satisfy to their own devices,<BR> since hardwares are evolving everyday.
		   If you are not rich enough, your game quality are always being limited.
		   Due to these reasons, Cloud Gaming has been invented.

		<BR>
		<H3>What is Cloud Gaming? </H2>
		<p> Cloud Gaming also known as game streaming, cloud gaming refers to using cloud servers to run games instead of using local devices.<BR>
			Basically, cloud gaming does not required users to download the game to the users' devices and<BR>
		    The games will run on the remote servers and stream the games to the users' devices.
		</p>
		<BR>
		<H3>How does cloud gaming work?</H3>

		<p> The basic idea of cloud gaming is like the other streaming platforms, such as "Netflix", "YouTube".
		    You will play your games on the server which owned by the companies that provide services.
		    Once you choose a game to play, the game will run in the server.
		    Then, every actions you made will become a command and send it to the server.
		    The server will execute the commands and streamed back to you with a small latency.
