# IT-project
Suppose you are a web developer of Internet Technology News, a website which hosts technology
news, reviews and archives that help readers easily understand how technology affects the way they
live. The editor of Internet Technology News wants two web page sections â€“ the first section
introduces ONE latest Internet Technology concept (or any one of which you learnt in SEHH1016),
the other section is used for collecting comments related to the first section.

As a web developer, you are required to provide your expertise for the editor and propose the design
of the web page sections for introducing an Internet Technology concept as well as a way to collect
comments for the Internet Technology News.
