    <H2><A NAME="BG_INFO">Background information</A></H2>
    <P>Nowadays, as the demands of gaming quality is being higher and higher, many gamers are not satisfy to their own devices. Since hardwares are evolving everyday, if you are not rich enough, your gaming experience will be limited. Due to these development, the
        <B>Cloud Gaming</B> has been invented. To help those gamer which not have ability to purchse a better gaming outfits.

    <H2><A NAME="DEFINTION">What is Cloud Gaming?</A></H2>

    <P>
        <B>Cloud Gaming</B> also known as game streaming, cloud gaming refers to using cloud servers to run games instead of using local devices.
        <BR> Basically, cloud gaming does not required user to download the game to the their device.
        <BR> The games will run on the remote servers and the games will streamed to users' device.
    </P>

    <BR>
    <HR>

    <H2><A NAME="WORKING_PRINCIPAL">How does cloud gaming work?</A></H2>

    <P> The basic idea of cloud gaming is like the other streaming platforms, such as "Netflix", "YouTube". You will play your games on the server which owned by the companies that provide services. Once you choose a game to play, the game will run in the server. Then, every actions you made will become a command and send it to the server. The server will execute the commands and streamed back to you with a small latency.

            <LI>The server received the action and input the action into the game.</LI>
            <LI>The game will get the action and refresh the screen.</LI>
            <LI>The user will received the screen after the action input.</LI>
            <LI>The loop will run again and again to allow user to play the game through internet.</LI>

    <H2><A NAME ="VIDEO" >Game/Video Streaming </A></H2> Player controls the game and it executed remotely. Meanwhile, the server processes the operations and render the actual game and image. Then, the video results are
    <U>transmitted directly</U> to a player’s computer or device.
    <BR> The server is capable for
    <B>processing needs</B> so that it allows player to play high resolution game without powerful console or device.
    <H2><A NAME ="COMMAND">Command Gaming </A></H2> Command gaming is kind of like game streaming because they are both stored and executed remotely. But the difference between these is that Command gaming is only process
    <B>game logic and graphic commands</B> while rendering occurs locally on the player’s device.
    <BR> It could reduce the latency because it does not need to transmit video.It requires less bandwidth from internet.
    <H2><A NAME ="PROGRESSING">Progressive Downloading </A></H2> Player need to download a
    <U>small number of files</U> to their device before playing the game. It could reduce the cost of sending patch and producing media.
    <BR> One of the disadvantages is that it does not support cross cross-platform.
